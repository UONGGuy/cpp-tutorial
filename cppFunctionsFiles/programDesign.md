# A GENERAL APPROACH TOWARDS DESIGNING PROGRAMS

## DESIGN

1. DEFINE GOAL
2. DEFINE REQUIREMENTS
3. DEFINE TOOLS, TARGETS, BACK-UP PLAN
4. DECONSTRUCT HARDER PROBLEMS INTO SMALLER EASIER PROBLEMS
5. FIGURE OUT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

## IMPLEMENTATION

1. OUTLINE MAIN FUNCTION
2. IMPLEMENT EACH FUNCTION
3. FINAL TESTING

### TIPS

- Start simple!
- Add features gradually
- Focus on one area at a time
- Test each piece of code as you go
- Remember cost-benefits of time vs practicality
- Don't repeat yourself - could it be turned into a function?
